# /update-plan

**What this does:** Reads the latest Review Mode annotations for the current file, implements requested changes, updates comment statuses, and re-opens the file in Review Mode.

**When to use:** After the user has added comments in Review Mode and types `/update-plan` or asks to apply their feedback.

**Prerequisite:** The `review-mode` MCP server must be configured in your MCP client settings.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1 — Identify the file

Determine which file to update:
- If the user specifies a file path, use that.
- If there is a current plan file from a recent planning interaction, use that by default.
- If unclear, call `list_reviewed_files(workspace="/path/to/project/root")` to see all files currently under review.
- If still unclear, ask the user.

### Step 2 — Fetch annotations

Use the `get_annotations` MCP tool:
```python
get_annotations(
  file_path="<relative-path-to-file>",
  workspace="/path/to/project/root"
)
```

If the result is empty (no revisions), tell the user:
> No review annotations found. Please open the file in Review Mode and add your comments first.

### Step 3 — Summarize

Print a summary of what you found:
> 📝 Found N annotations (X open, Y in-progress, Z resolved).

If there are no open or in-progress annotations:
> ✅ All annotations are already resolved. Nothing to do.

### Step 4 — Implement changes

For each annotation with status `open` or `in-progress`:
1. Read the `textPreview` and `thread` to understand what the user wants.
2. Edit the `.md` file to implement the change.
3. If the comment is unclear, skip it for now and note it for Step 5.

### Step 5 — Resolve annotations

After implementing the changes, update annotations using the MCP tool:

```python
# Resolve specific IDs that were implemented
update_annotation(
  file_path="<file>",
  annotation_ids=["id1", "id2"],
  status="resolved",
  message="Implemented",
  workspace="/path/to/project/root"
)

# For comments needing clarification
update_annotation(
  file_path="<file>",
  annotation_ids=["id3"],
  status="in-progress",
  message="Need more details — see reply",
  workspace="/path/to/project/root"
)
```

### Step 6 — Re-open in Review Mode

```python
open_review(
  file_path="<relative-path-to-file>",
  workspace="/path/to/project/root"
)
```

The extension will detect the file change and automatically create a new revision with migrated annotations.

### Step 7 — Report

Print a status message:
> 📋 Plan updated and ready for review. N comments resolved, M need your input.

Then say:
> _"I've updated the plan based on your comments. Take a look and let me know if you have more feedback."_
