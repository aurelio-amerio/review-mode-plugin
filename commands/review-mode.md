# /review-mode

**What this does:** Opens the current plan or a specified Markdown file in Review Mode so the user can annotate it with inline comments.

**When to use:** When the user explicitly types `/review-mode` or asks to open a file in Review Mode.

**Prerequisites:**
- The [Review Mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aurelio-amerio.review-mode) VS Code extension must be installed.
- The `review-mode` MCP server must be configured in your MCP client settings.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1 — Identify the file

Determine which file to open:
- If the user specifies a file path, use that.
- If there is a current plan file from a recent planning interaction, use that.
- If unclear, ask the user.

### Step 2 — Open in Review Mode

Use the `open_review` MCP tool:
```python
open_review(
  file_path="relative/path/to/file.md",
  workspace="/path/to/project/root"
)
```

### Step 3 — Confirm

Print a brief status message:
> 📋 The file has been opened in Review Mode. Add your comments, then type `/update` when you're ready for me to act on them.

Do **NOT** print the file content in chat. The user will read it in the Review Mode panel.
